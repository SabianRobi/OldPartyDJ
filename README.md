# PartyDJ

## Archived project
**Currently this project is being rewritten in Spring Boot.**
There are some comments in JS files which explains how things work, it's only intended to help my teammate who makes a new frontend, it's not an official, good looking documentation.

## Introduction

Have you ever been at a house party and wanted to play your favourite music? With this fullstack web application it is possible that everyone who participating the party can play their songs! But how does it work? 

The owner of the party can create a party and others can join. Everyone in the party can add tracks from their own device to the queue, which plays automatically. They don't have to borrow anyone elses phone or go to the laptop to add your music. Just tap it on your favourite music on your own phone, and it will play.

## Features
- Playing songs from Spotify & YouTube
- Protecting parties with password
- No stupid credit system
- No user limit
- Data saver mode
- Party won't be deleted if anyone still participating

## Future ideas
- Choosable themes
- Like and dislike tracks in queue, and auto-remove the wrong rated songs
- Auto-skip very disliked songs
- Lyrics display
- A 'flashback' page, where users can see the previous parties they attended, the songs played (with timestamp)
- Login with social account (Google, Facebook ...)
- More music platform support (Tidal, Apple Music, Deezer, YT Music)

### Foot note
I'm developing this project as a hobby, it is possible that I don't actively make updates.
