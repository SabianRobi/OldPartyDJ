# Ideas
- Make more choosable theme
- like / disable current in-queue songs
- Lyrics
- Split MusicController into SpotifyController, and MusicController
- A 'flashback' page, where the user can see the previous parties they attended, the songs played (with timestamp)
    - Add 'addedAt / playedAt' timestamp to queued tracks
- When a user watching queued songs, get automatic updates
- Write documentation

# Before deployment:
- Update packages (especially phpseclib)
# After deployment:
Set Spotify client id, secret, redirect uri in .env file
Generate DB


# NOW:
Profile settings -> Platform management
