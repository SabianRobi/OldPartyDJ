- like / disable current in-queue songs
- Lyrics
- Split MusicController into SpotifyController, and MusicController

# After deployment:
Set Spotify client id, secret, redirect uri in .env file
Generate DB

# Has to be completed until a private party:
- Guard all of controller endpoints
- Player todos
- Add info to main page
- Elevate the error message when trying to join/create party unauthenticated
- Get next song according to the highest score (and date beside that)
